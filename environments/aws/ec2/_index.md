## Debugging

For debugging code, use c9 development instances. Select Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 instances. They will provide a native linux environment to do your work. 

## EC2 instances

Please always select Ubuntu 20.04 or 18.04 with the Deep Learning AMI fir this image and start with a c4.xlarge for initial runs. Calculate the **costs** daily and budget your runs accordingly.
